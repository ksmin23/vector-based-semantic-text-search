In addition the stream is encrypted using SSL with certificates for both the server and all clients. This system works well, except that periodically the client needs to send really large amounts of data. An obvious solution would be to compress the data on the client side, send it over, and decompress it on the server. Rather than implement this myself, I was hoping to use Apache's mod_deflate's \\\"Input Decompression\\\" as described here. The description warns: If you evaluate the request body yourself, don't trust the Content-Length header! The Content-Length header reflects the length of the incoming data from the client and not the byte count of the decompressed data stream. So if I provide a Content-Length value which matches the compressed data size, the data is truncated. This is because mod_deflate decompresses the stream, but CGI.pm only reads to the Content-Length limit. Alternatively, if I try to outsmart it and override the Content-Length header with the decompressed data size, LWP complains and resets the value to the compressed length, leaving me with the same problem. Finally, I attempted to hack the part of LWP which does the correction. The original code is: # Set (or override) Content-Length header my $clen = $request_headers->header('Content-Length'); if (defined($$content_ref) && length($$content_ref)) { $has_content = length($$content_ref); if (!defined($clen) || $clen ne $has_content) { if (defined $clen) { warn \\\"Content-Length header value was wrong, fixed\\\"; hlist_remove(\\\\@h, 'Content-Length'); } push(@h, 'Content-Length' => $has_content); } } elsif ($clen) { warn \\\"Content-Length set when there is no content, fixed\\\"; hlist_remove(\\\\@h, 'Content-Length'); } And I changed the push line to: push(@h, 'Content-Length' => $clen); Unfortunately this causes some problem where content (truncated or not) doesn't even get to my CGI script. Has anyone made this work? I found this which does compression on a file before uploading, but not compressing a generic request. \"},\n",

I need this so all the original numbers can all be multiplied out to the same scale and be processed by a sealed system that will only deal with whole numbers, then I can retrieve the results and divide them by the common multiplier to get my relative results. Currently we do a few checks on the numbers and multiply by 100 or 1,000,000, but the processing done by the *sealed system can get quite expensive when dealing with large numbers so multiplying everything by a million just for the sake of it isn\\u2019t really a great option. As an approximation lets say that the sealed algorithm gets 10 times more expensive every time you multiply by a factor of 10. What is the most efficient algorithm, that will also give the best possible result, to accomplish what I need and is there a mathematical name and/or formula for what I\\u2019m need? *The sealed system isn\\u2019t really sealed. I own/maintain the source code for it but its 100,000 odd lines of proprietary magic and it has been thoroughly bug and performance tested, altering it to deal with floats is not an option for many reasons. It is a system that creates a grid of X by Y cells, then rects that are X by Y are dropped into the grid, \\u201cproprietary magic\\u201d occurs and results are spat out \\u2013 obviously this is an extremely simplified version of reality, but it\\u2019s a good enough approximation. So far there are quiet a few good answers and I wondered how I should go about choosing the \\u2018correct\\u2019 one. To begin with I figured the only fair way was to create each solution and performance test it, but I later realised that pure speed wasn\\u2019t the only relevant factor \\u2013 an more accurate solution is also very relevant. I wrote the performance tests anyway, but currently the I\\u2019m choosing the correct answer based on speed as well accuracy using a \\u2018gut feel\\u2019 formula. My performance tests process 1000 different sets of 100 randomly generated numbers. Each algorithm is tested using the same set of random numbers. Algorithms are written in .Net 3.5 (although thus far would be 2.0 compatible) I tried pretty hard to make the tests as fair as possible. Greg \\u2013 Multiply by large number and then divide by GCD \\u2013 63 milliseconds Andy \\u2013 String Parsing \\u2013 199 milliseconds Eric \\u2013 Decimal.GetBits \\u2013 160 milliseconds Eric \\u2013 Binary search \\u2013 32 milliseconds Ima \\u2013 sorry I couldn\\u2019t figure out a how to implement your solution easily in .Net (I didn\\u2019t want to spend too long on it) Bill \\u2013 I figure your answer was pretty close to Greg\\u2019s so didn\\u2019t implement it. I\\u2019m sure it\\u2019d be a smidge faster but potentially less accurate. So Greg\\u2019s Multiply by large number and then divide by GCD\\u201d solution was the second fastest algorithm and it gave the most accurate results so for now I\\u2019m calling it correct. I really wanted the Decimal.GetBits solution to be the fastest, but it was very slow, I\\u2019m unsure if this is due to the conversion of a Double to a Decimal or the Bit masking and shifting. There should be a similar usable solution for a straight Double using the BitConverter.GetBytes and some knowledge contained here: http://blogs.msdn.com/bclteam/archive/2007/05/29/bcl-refresher-floating-point-types-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-inbar-gazit-matthew-greig.aspx but my eyes just kept glazing over every time I read that article and I eventually ran out of time to try to implement a solution. I\\u2019m always open to other solutions if anyone can think of something better. \"},\n",
